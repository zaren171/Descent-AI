#1:
As you open the door you hear growling and the shuffle of feet.  Your torches illuminate a natural cavern to reveal what appears to be crude living quarters.  Piles of junk lie strewn about the room.  The smell of wet dog and burnt hair assails your nostrils.

<Encounter:
You rummage through a particularly large and smelly pile of rubbish.  Amist the rotting food and decay you discover a Healing Potion.

#2:
You unlock the door and pull it open to reveal an even more pungent stench.  Bones lie scattered here and there in this large natrual cavern.  A large Ogre loks up from its current meal (A half devoured sheep) and glares at you with intent.
